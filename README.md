# TableModel - [Live Demo](https://target.github.io/table-model/)

TableModel is an in-memory data model that automatically calculates your data based on provided equations.
It keeps track of dependencies between data and equations and automatically updates cells quickly and efficiently.

TableModel works especially well with UI components like AgGrid because it simplifies your data flow and can add
additional features such as predicting which cells in your table are going to be impacted by a change (see below).

### Preview: AgGrid powered by TableModel ([AgGrid not included](https://www.ag-grid.com/))

## Getting Started

Install table-model:

```
npm install --save-dev table-model
```

Import the 'table-model' module into your project:

ES6+
```
import TableModel from 'table-model';
```
CommonJS
```
const TableModel = require('table-model');
```

## Usage
A unit test of the following example can be found at `src/example.spec.js`
```
// Formulas
const totalEquation = d => d.row('a') + d.row('b') + d.row('c');
const extraEquation = d => d.row('b') * d.row('c');

// This builds a formula that matches a given color
const colorTotals = color => {
  return d => {
    // Get the 'total's from all rows with the matching color
    const numbers = d.rowsWhere({ type: color }, 'total');
    // Sum up the numbers to get to total
    return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
  };
};

// This array contains a list of our rows and their cells
const rowDefs = [
  // Row 1
  {
    meta: { id: 1, type: 'red' },
    cells: { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30, total: totalEquation }
  },
  // Row 2
  {
    meta: { id: 2, type: 'green' },
    // Rows don't have to have the same types of cells
    cells: { a: 12, b: 45, c: 38, d: 1234, total: totalEquation, extra: extraEquation }
  },
  // Row 3
  {
    meta: { id: 3, type: 'red' },
    cells: { a: 100, b: 200, c: 300, total: totalEquation }
  },
  // Totals
  {
    meta: { id: 4 },
    cells: { redTotal: colorTotals('red'), greenTotal: colorTotals('green') }
  }
];

const listener = updates => console.log('UPDATES:', updates);

const table = TableModel({ rowDefs, listener });

// Output: All cell values are included in the first update

// UPDATES: {
//   1: { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30, total: 60 },
//   2: { a: 12, b: 45, c: 38, d: 1234, total: 95, extra: 1710 },
//   3: { a: 100, b: 200, c: 300, total: 600 },
//   4: { redTotal: 660, greenTotal: 95 }
// });

table.update({ 2: { c: 123 } });

// Output: Only cells that were impacted by the update are included after that

// UPDATES: {
//   2: { c: 123, total: 180, extra: 5535 },
//   4: { greenTotal: 180 }
// });
```

## Why?

#### Fast
> Because TableModel analyzes your equations, it knows which other values and equations are impacted by
> any given change. This ensures that when a change happens, TableModel only does the minimum amount of work
it needs to do.

#### Testable
> If you're using a UI library like AgGrid to do your calculations for you, it can add an additional
> layer of complexity when trying to test. AgGrid requires a DOM to run and test with. This is not ideal
> for the simplicity and performance of your tests.
>
> By using TableModel to handle your data, you can write units tests for your equations which are
> simple and easy to write, and decoupled from the view. See an example TableModel unit test at `src/example.spec.js`.

#### Maintainable
> If your data model has a lot of calculations your code base can get complicated very quickly,
> for example, maintaining the proper order of the calculations, and determining which values need to be recalculated
> (or not) when another values changes.
>
> TableModel abstracts all this complexity away for you. All you have to do is define simple
> equations, feed TableModel your data, and it'll take care of the rest. **TableModel automatically manages the
> dependencies between your equations.** If you need to make changes down the road, you only have to update your
> equations.

#### Separation of Concerns -or- "Do one thing and do it well"
> If you're using a library like AgGrid to render your data in a UI component, you might
> realize that AgGrid is REALLY good at presenting data, but has some limitations when trying
> to handle calculations, for example, trying to operate on data in multiple rows.
>
> By using TableModel with AgGrid, you can use AgGrid to do what it does best (display data - the View)
> and let TableModel take care of what it does best (calculation and data management - the Model).
